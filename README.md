# Slam
This is an engineering project for helping walker avoid obstacles and build map.

Because we want to commercialize our product, we have to limit our investment but still achieve certain accuracy.
Comparing with multi-sensor fusion, our programme only use lidar data. This will cause accumulate error and other problems that reduce accuracy. Also, the operating environment cannot be that much complicated. 

This is the first step we set foot in slam. I believe we will do a better work in the future.
